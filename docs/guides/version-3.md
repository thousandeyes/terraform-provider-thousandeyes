# ThousandEyes Terraform Provider Version 3 Upgrade Guide

Version 3.0.0 of the ThousandEyes Terraform provider is a major release that introduces significant changes. If you are upgrading from version 1.x or 2.x, review this guide to understand the required updates and ensure a smooth migration.

Upgrade topics:

- [Provider Version Configuration](#provider-version-configuration)
- [Provider Arguments](#provider-arguments)
- [Labels to Tags migration](#labels-to-tags-migration)
- [Integrations Data source](#integrations-data-source)
- [Test schema changes](#test-schema-changes)
- [Other notable changes](#other-notable-changes)
- [Additional resources](#additional-resources)

## Provider version configuration

Update your provider version constraint and run [`terraform init -upgrade`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/init) to download the new version.

**Example:**

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    thousandeyes = {
      source  = "thousandeyes/thousandeyes"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "thousandeyes" {
  # Configuration options
}
```

## Provider Arguments

The `api_sdk_logs_enabled` argument was added. The default value is `false`.

## Labels to Tags migration

Both Groups and Labels have been deprecated in ThousandEyes API v7 and are no longer supported in the current version of the provider. Instead, [Tags](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/thousandeyes/tags-api-overview/) are now used as a replacement for Labels.
Tags maintain backwards compatibility with any existing Groups and Labels. However, Tags can no longer be assigned directly to tests using its own resource; instead, the `thousandeyes_tag_assignment` resource should be used for this purpose.

**Before (using `thousandeyes_label`):**

```hcl
resource "thousandeyes_label" "example_label" {
  # ... other configuration ...
  
  tests {
    test_id = 123456
  }
}
```

**After (using `thousandeyes_tag` and `thousandeyes_tag_assignment`):**

```hcl
resource "thousandeyes_tag" "example_tag" {
  key         = "Example Tag Key"
  value       = "Example Tag Value"
  object_type = "test"
  color       = "#b3de69"
  access_type = "all"
  icon        = "LABEL"
}

resource "thousandeyes_tag_assignment" "example_assignment" {
  tag_id = data.thousandeyes_tag.example_tag.id

  assignments {
    id   = "123456" #Id of existing entity (Test, Dashboard, etc.)
    type = "test"
  }
}
```

## Integrations Data source

## Integrations Data source

With the retirement of the Integrations API, the `thousandeyes_integration` data source has been removed. You can still reference existing integrations by their ID.

**Before (using `thousandeyes_integration`):**

```hcl
data "thousandeyes_integration" "example_integration" {
  integration_name = "test-pd-service"
}

resource "thousandeyes_alert_rule" "example_alert_rule" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  notifications {
    third_party {
      integration_id = data.thousandeyes_integration.example_integration.id
      integration_type = data.thousandeyes_integration.example_integration.integration_type
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**

```hcl
resource "thousandeyes_alert_rule" "example_alert_rule" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  notifications {
    third_party {
      integration_id = "integration-id" # Replace with the actual integration ID
      integration_type = "integration_type" # Replace with the actual integration type
    }
  }
}
```

## Test schema changes

The following attributes in test resources have been updated for consistency and alignment with the ThousandEyes v7 API. Review and update your configurations accordingly:

- **`alert_rules`**: Now a set of strings representing alert rule IDs. Previously, this was a block set with objects containing a `rule_id` field.
- **`agents`**: Now a set of strings representing agent IDs. Previously, this was a block set with objects containing an `agent_id` field.
- **`bgp_monitors` → `monitors`**: The attribute has been renamed to `monitors` and is now a set of strings representing BGP monitor IDs, instead of a block set with objects containing a `monitor_id` field.
- **`shared_with_accounts`**: Now a set of strings representing account IDs. Previously, this was a block list with objects containing an `aid` field.
- **`dns_servers`**: Now a set of strings representing DNS server names. Previously, this was a block set with objects containing a `server_name` and optionally a `server_id`.
- **`use_public_bgp`**: The default value for this attribute is no longer set in the resource schema. Instead, the provider now relies on the default behavior defined by the ThousandEyes API.
- **`api_links` → `link`**: The attribute has been renamed to `link`.
- **`target_agent_id`**: Now a string value instead of a numeric value.
- **`dscp_id`**: Now a string value instead of a numeric value.
- **`test_id`**: Now a string value instead of a numeric value.

**Before:**

```hcl
resource "thousandeyes_dns_server" "dns_server_test" {
  test_name      = "Example DNS server test"
  interval       = 120
  domain         = "www.thousandeyes.com ANY"
  dns_servers {
    server_name = "ns1.google.com"
  }
  agents {
    agent_id = 123
  }
  alert_rules {
    rule_id = 123
  }
  shared_with_accounts  {
    aid = 123
  }
  bgp_monitors {
    monitor_id = 123
  }
}
```

**After:**

```hcl
resource "thousandeyes_dns_server" "dns_server_test" {
  test_name      = "Example DNS server test"
  interval       = 120
  domain         = "www.thousandeyes.com ANY"
  dns_servers    = ["ns1.google.com"]
  agents         = ["123"]
  alert_rules    = ["123"]
  shared_with_accounts = ["123"]
  monitors       = ["123"]
}
```

## Other notable changes

- Version 3 of this provider is only compatible with the [ThousandEyes API v7](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/thousandeyes/introduction/). The provider exclusively uses the v7 API, and some fields or behaviors may differ from earlier API versions.
- Error messages and diagnostics have been enhanced and may be stricter than in previous versions.
