# thousandeyes_page_load (Resource)

This resource allows you to create a page load test. This test type obtains in-browser site performance metrics. For more information, see [Page Load Tests](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests#page-load-test).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "thousandeyes_page_load" "test" {
  test_name      = "Example Page Load test set from Terraform provider"
  alerts_enabled = false
  url            = "https://www.thousandeyes.com"
  interval       = 120
  http_interval  = 120
  agents         = ["3"] # Singapore
}
```
