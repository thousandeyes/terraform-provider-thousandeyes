# thousandeyes_label (Resource)

This resource allows you to create labels for ThousandEyes agents and test groups. Labels are used to quickly select an agent group or a test group, and apply them to a specific context (for example, applying a group of tests to an agent). For more information, see [Working with Labels](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/working-with-labels-for-agent-and-test-groups).
