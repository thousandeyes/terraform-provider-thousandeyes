# thousandeyes_alert_rule (Resource)

This resource allows you to create alert rules for ThousandEyes alerts. Alert rules define what alerts are sent, when, and to whom. For more information, see [Alert Rules](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts#rule-configuration).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "thousandeyes_alert_rule" "example_alert_rule" {
  rule_name                 = "Example Alert Rule set from Terraform provider"
  alert_type                = "http-server"
  expression                = "((errorType != \"None\"))" # Error Type is ANY
  rounds_violating_required = 1
  rounds_violating_out_of   = 1
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `alert_type` (String) The type of alert rule.
- `expression` (String) The alert rule evaluation expression.
- `rounds_violating_out_of` (Number) Specifies the divisor (Y value) of the “X of Y times” condition in an alert rule.  Minimum value is 1, maximum value is 10.
- `rounds_violating_required` (Number) Specifies the numerator (X value) of the “X of Y times” condition in an alert rule.  Minimum value is 1, maximum value is 10. Must be less than or equal to 'roundsViolatingOutOf'.
- `rule_name` (String) The name of the alert rule.

### Optional

- `alert_group_type` (String) The type of alert group.
- `direction` (String) [to-target, from-target, bidirectional] The direction of the test (affects how results are shown).
- `endpoint_agent_ids` (Set of String) An array of endpoint agent IDs associated with the rule (get `id` from `/endpoint/agents` API). This is applicable when `alertGroupType` is `browser-session`.
- `endpoint_label_ids` (Set of String) An array of label IDs used to assign specific Endpoint Agents to the test (get `id` from `/endpoint/labels`). This is applicable when `alertGroupType` is `browser-session`.
- `include_covered_prefixes` (Boolean) Include queries for subprefixes detected under this prefix.
- `is_default` (Boolean) If set to `true`, this alert rule becomes the default for its test type and is automatically applied to newly created tests with relevant metrics. Only one default alert rule is allowed per test type.
- `minimum_sources` (Number) The minimum number of agents or monitors that must meet the specified criteria in order to trigger an alert. This option is mutually exclusive with 'minimum_sources_pct'.
- `minimum_sources_pct` (Number) The minimum percentage of agents or monitors that must meet the specified criteria in order to trigger an alert. This option is mutually exclusive with 'minimum_sources'.
- `notifications` (Block Set) The list of notifications for the alert rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--notifications))
- `notify_on_clear` (Boolean) Set to 'true' to trigger the notification when the alert clears.
- `rounds_violating_mode` (String) [any, auto or exact] Defines whether the same agent(s) must meet the 'exact' same threshold in consecutive rounds or not. The default value is 'any'.
- `sensitivity_level` (String) [high, medium or low] Defines sensitivity level.
- `severity` (String) [info, minor, major, critical or unknown] The severity level of the alert rule. The default value is 'info'.
- `visited_sites_filter` (Set of String) A list of website domains visited during the session. This is applicable when `alertGroupType` is `browser-session`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `link` (String) Its value is either a URI [RFC3986] or a URI template [RFC6570].
- `rule_id` (String) The unique ID of the alert rule.
