# thousandeyes_http_server (Resource)

This resource allows you to create an HTTP server test. This test type measures the availability and performance of an HTTP service. For more information, see [HTTP Server Tests](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests#http-server-test).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "thousandeyes_http_server" "example_http_server_test" {
  test_name      = "Example HTTP test set from Terraform provider"
  interval       = 120
  alerts_enabled = false

  url = "https://www.thousandeyes.com"

  agents {
    agent_id = 3 # Singapore
  }
}
```
