# thousandeyes_agent_to_agent (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and configure an agent-to-agent test. This test type evaluates the performance of the underlying network between two physical sites. For more information about agent-to-agent tests, see [Agent-to-Agent Tests](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests#agent-to-agent-test).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "thousandeyes_agent_to_agent" "example_agent_to_agent_test" {
  test_name      = "Example Agent to Agent test set from Terraform provider"
  interval       = 120
  alerts_enabled = false

  direction = "TO_TARGET"
  protocol = "TCP"
  target_agent_id = "5"

  agents {
    agent_id = 3 # Singapore
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `agents` (Set of String) The list of ThousandEyes agent IDs to use.
- `direction` (String) [to-target, from-target, bidirectional] The direction of the test (affects how results are shown).
- `interval` (Number) The interval to run the test on, in seconds.
- `target_agent_id` (String) The target agent's unique ID. Pulled from the /agents endpoint. Both the 'agents': [] and the targetAgentID cannot be Cloud Agents. Can be Enterprise Agent -> Cloud, Cloud -> Enterprise Agent, or Enterprise Agent -> Enterprise Agent.

### Optional

- `alert_rules` (Set of String) List of alert rules IDs to apply to the test (get `ruleId` from `/alerts/rules` endpoint. If `alertsEnabled` is set to `true` and `alertRules` is not included on test creation or update, applicable user default alert rules will be used)
- `alerts_enabled` (Boolean) Set to 'true' to enable alerts, or 'false' to disable alerts. The default value is 'true'.
- `bgp_measurements` (Boolean) Enable BGP measurements. Set to true for enabled, false for disabled.
- `description` (String) A description of the alert rule. Defaults to an empty string.
- `dscp_id` (String) The DSCP ID.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enables or disables the test.
- `fixed_packet_rate` (Number) Sets packets rate sent to measure the network in packets per second.
- `labels` (Set of String) ["1", "2", "uuid"] The array of label or tag ids.
- `monitors` (Set of String) Contains list of BGP monitor IDs (get `monitorId` from `/monitors` endpoint)
- `mss` (Number) The maximum segment size, in bytes. Value can be from 30 to 1400.
- `num_path_traces` (Number) The number of path traces.
- `path_trace_mode` (String) [classic or in-session] Choose 'inSession' to perform the path trace within a TCP session. Default value is 'classic'.
- `port` (Number) The target port.
- `protocol` (String) [tcp or udp] The protocol for agent to agent tests. Defaults to 'tcp'.
- `randomized_start_time` (Boolean) Indicates whether agents should randomize the start time in each test round.
- `shared_with_accounts` (Set of String) List of accounts
- `test_name` (String) The name of the test.
- `throughput_duration` (Number) The throughput duration in milliseconds. The default value is 10000.
- `throughput_measurements` (Boolean) Enables or disables throughput measurements. This is not allowed when the source or target of the test is a Cloud Agent. Defaults to disabled.
- `throughput_rate` (Number) Defines the throughput rate. Fo UDP tests only.
- `use_public_bgp` (Boolean) Enable to automatically add all available Public BGP Monitors to the test.

### Read-Only

- `created_by` (String) Created by user.
- `created_date` (String) The date of creation.
- `dscp` (String) The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) label.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `link` (String) Its value is either a URI [RFC3986] or a URI template [RFC6570].
- `live_share` (Boolean) Set to 'true' for a test shared with your account group, or to 'false' for a normal test.
- `modified_by` (String) Last modified by this user.
- `modified_date` (String) The date the test was last modified. Shown in UTC.
- `saved_event` (Boolean) Set to 'true' for a saved event, or to 'false' for a normal test.
- `test_id` (String) The unique ID of the test.
- `type` (String) The type of test.
