# thousandeyes_sip_server (Resource)

This resource allows you to create a SIP server test. This test type checks for the availability and performance of a VoIP SIP server, confirms the ability to perform SIP Register with a target server, and observes the requests and responses. For more information, see [SIP Server Tests](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests#sip-server-test).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "thousandeyes_sip_server" "example_sip_server_test" {
  test_name      = "Example SIP server test set from Terraform provider"
  interval       = 120
  alerts_enabled = false

  target_sip_credentials {
    auth_user     = ""
    protocol      = "TCP"
    port          = 5060
    sip_registrar = "example.org"
  }

  agents {
    agent_id = 3 # Singapore
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `agents` (Set of String) The list of ThousandEyes agent IDs to use.
- `interval` (Number) The interval to run the test on, in seconds.
- `test_name` (String) The name of the test.

### Optional

- `alert_rules` (Set of String) List of alert rules IDs to apply to the test (get `ruleId` from `/alerts/rules` endpoint. If `alertsEnabled` is set to `true` and `alertRules` is not included on test creation or update, applicable user default alert rules will be used)
- `alerts_enabled` (Boolean) Set to 'true' to enable alerts, or 'false' to disable alerts. The default value is 'true'.
- `bgp_measurements` (Boolean) Enable BGP measurements. Set to true for enabled, false for disabled.
- `description` (String) A description of the alert rule. Defaults to an empty string.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enables or disables the test.
- `fixed_packet_rate` (Number) Sets packets rate sent to measure the network in packets per second.
- `ipv6_policy` (String) [force-ipv4, prefer-ipv6, force-ipv6, or use-agent-policy]
- `labels` (Set of String) ["1", "2", "uuid"] The array of label or tag ids.
- `monitors` (Set of String) Contains list of BGP monitor IDs (get `monitorId` from `/monitors` endpoint)
- `mtu_measurements` (Boolean) Measure MTU sizes on the network from agents to the target.
- `network_measurements` (Boolean) Set to 'true' to enable network measurements.
- `num_path_traces` (Number) The number of path traces.
- `options_regex` (String) A regex string of options. This field does not require escaping.
- `path_trace_mode` (String) [classic or in-session] Choose 'inSession' to perform the path trace within a TCP session. Default value is 'classic'.
- `probe_mode` (String) [auto, sack, or syn] The probe mode used by end-to-end network tests. This is only valid if the protocol is set to TCP. The default value is AUTO.
- `randomized_start_time` (Boolean) Indicates whether agents should randomize the start time in each test round.
- `register_enabled` (Boolean) Configure whether to perform SIP registration on the test target with the SIP REGISTER command. Default value is 'false'.
- `shared_with_accounts` (Set of String) List of accounts
- `sip_target_time` (Number) The target time for test completion, specified in milliseconds.
- `sip_time_limit` (Number) The test time limit. Can be between 5 and 10 seconds, and defaults to 5 seconds.
- `target_sip_credentials` (Block Set) Target SIP credentials (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--target_sip_credentials))
- `use_public_bgp` (Boolean) Enable to automatically add all available Public BGP Monitors to the test.

### Read-Only

- `created_by` (String) Created by user.
- `created_date` (String) The date of creation.

- `link` (String) Its value is either a URI [RFC3986] or a URI template [RFC6570].
- `live_share` (Boolean) Set to 'true' for a test shared with your account group, or to 'false' for a normal test.
- `modified_by` (String) Last modified by this user.
- `modified_date` (String) The date the test was last modified. Shown in UTC.
- `saved_event` (Boolean) Set to 'true' for a saved event, or to 'false' for a normal test.
- `test_id` (String) The unique ID of the test.
- `type` (String) The type of test.

### Nested Schema for `target_sip_credentials`

Required:

- `auth_user` (String) The username for authentication with the SIP server.
- `protocol` (String) [tcp, tls, or udp] The transport layer for SIP communication. Can be either TCP, TLS (TLS over TCP), or UDP, and defaults to tcp.
- `sip_registrar` (String) The SIP server to be tested, specified by domain name or IP address.

Optional:
