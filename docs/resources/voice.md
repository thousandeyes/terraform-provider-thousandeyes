# thousandeyes_voice (Resource)

This resource allows you to create a RTP Stream test. This test type measures the quality of real-time protocol (RTP) voice streams between ThousandEyes agents that act as VoIP user agents. For more information, see [RTP Stream Tests](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests#rtp-stream-test).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "thousandeyes_voice" "example_voice_test" {
  test_name        = "Example RTP stream test set from Terraform provider"
  interval         = 120
  alerts_enabled   = false
  bgp_measurements = true
  use_public_bgp   = true
  target_agent_id  = "4"   # Tokyo
  agents           = ["3"] # Singapore
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `agents` (Set of String) The list of ThousandEyes agent IDs to use.
- `interval` (Number) The interval to run the test on, in seconds.

### Optional

- `alert_rules` (Set of String) List of alert rules IDs to apply to the test (get `ruleId` from `/alerts/rules` endpoint. If `alertsEnabled` is set to `true` and `alertRules` is not included on test creation or update, applicable user default alert rules will be used)
- `alerts_enabled` (Boolean) Set to 'true' to enable alerts, or 'false' to disable alerts. The default value is 'true'.
- `bgp_measurements` (Boolean) Enable BGP measurements. Set to true for enabled, false for disabled.
- `codec_id` (String) The unique ID of the codec to use.
- `description` (String) A description of the alert rule. Defaults to an empty string.
- `dscp_id` (String) The DSCP ID.
- `duration` (Number) The duration of the test, in seconds (5 to 30).
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enables or disables the test.
- `jitter_buffer` (Number) The de-jitter buffer size, in seconds (0 to 150).
- `monitors` (Set of String) Contains list of BGP monitor IDs (get `monitorId` from `/monitors` endpoint)
- `num_path_traces` (Number) The number of path traces.
- `randomized_start_time` (Boolean) Indicates whether agents should randomize the start time in each test round.
- `shared_with_accounts` (Set of String) List of accounts
- `test_name` (String) The name of the test.
- `use_public_bgp` (Boolean) Enable to automatically add all available Public BGP Monitors to the test.

### Read-Only

- `codec` (String) The label of the codec.
- `created_by` (String) Created by user.
- `created_date` (String) The date of creation.
- `dscp` (String) The Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) label.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `labels` (Set of String, Deprecated) ["1", "2"] The array of labels.
- `link` (String) Its value is either a URI [RFC3986] or a URI template [RFC6570].
- `live_share` (Boolean) Set to 'true' for a test shared with your account group, or to 'false' for a normal test.
- `modified_by` (String) Last modified by this user.
- `modified_date` (String) The date the test was last modified. Shown in UTC.
- `saved_event` (Boolean) Set to 'true' for a saved event, or to 'false' for a normal test.
- `test_id` (String) The unique ID of the test.
- `type` (String) The type of test.

## Import
In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) providing `resource_id`.
```terraform
import {
  to = thousandeyes_voice.example_voice_test
  id = "resource_id"
}
```

Using `terraform import` command.
```shell
terraform import thousandeyes_voice.example_voice_test resource_id
```
