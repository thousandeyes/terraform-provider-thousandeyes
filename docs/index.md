# thousandeyes Provider

The [ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/) provider is used to interact with the resources supported by ThousandEyes.

This provider version is only compatible with the [ThousandEyes API v7](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/thousandeyes/introduction/).

The same breaking changes are applied to the provider as they are to the API.

Use the left navigation bar to read about the available resources.

### Deprecation notice
Labels and Integrations resources were deprecated in ThousandEyes API v7 and are no longer supported in this provider version.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    thousandeyes = {
      source  = "thousandeyes/thousandeyes"
      version = ">= 3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "thousandeyes" {
  token            = "your-token"
  account_group_id = "your-account-id"
}

data "thousandeyes_agent" "arg_cordoba" {
  agent_name = "Cordoba, Argentina"
}

resource "thousandeyes_http_server" "www_thousandeyes_http_test" {

  interval       = 120
  alerts_enabled = false
  url            = "https://www.thousandeyes.com"
